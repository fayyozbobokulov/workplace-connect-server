## Email Template Preview

The email includes:

- **Call-to-Action Button** linking to your frontend
- **Responsive Design** that works on all devices
- **Professional Footer** with branding

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Authentication Failed"
- **Gmail**: Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
- **Outlook**: Try enabling "Less secure app access"
- **Yahoo**: Generate and use an App Password

#### 2. "Connection Refused"
- Check your EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT settings
- Ensure your firewall isn't blocking SMTP connections

#### 3. "Email not configured" message
- Verify all EMAIL_* environment variables are set in your .env file
- Restart your server after updating .env

### Debug Mode
To see detailed email logs, check your server console output:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit .env files** - They're already in .gitignore
2. **Use App Passwords** - Don't use your main email password
3. **Rotate Passwords** - Change app passwords periodically
4. **Environment Variables** - Use different credentials for production

## Production Deployment

For production, consider using:
- **SendGrid** - Professional email service
- **AWS SES** - Amazon's email service  
- **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly email API
- **Custom SMTP** - Your organization's email server

## API Integration

The email service is automatically integrated with:
- `POST /api/friend-requests` - Bulk friend requests by email
- Individual friend request creation

No additional API calls needed - emails are sent automatically when friend requests are created.

## Customization

To customize email templates, edit:
- `/src/services/email.service.ts` - Email templates and logic
- HTML template in `generateFriendRequestEmailTemplate()`
- Text template in `generateFriendRequestEmailText()`

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your email provider's SMTP settings
3. Test with a simple email client first
4. Ensure your email credentials are correct

**Note**: The system works perfectly without email configuration - it will simply log what emails would be sent instead of actually sending them.
